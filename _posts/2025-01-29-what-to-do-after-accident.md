Nobody plans to get into an accident, but knowing what to do when it happens can save you money, stress, and headaches down the road. As someone who's helped hundreds of customers navigate the post-accident process, here's my step-by-step guide.

## At the Scene

**1. Safety First**  
Move to a safe location if possible. Turn on hazard lights. If anyone is injured, call 911 immediately.

**2. Call the Police**  
Even for minor accidents, get a police report. This official documentation will be crucial for insurance claims.

**3. Exchange Information**  
Get the other driver's:
- Name and contact info
- Insurance company and policy number
- License plate and driver's license number
- Make, model, and color of vehicle

**4. Document Everything**  
Take photos of:
- All vehicle damage (yours and theirs)
- The accident scene from multiple angles
- License plates
- Street signs and surroundings
- Any visible injuries

You can't take too many photos. Your phone's camera is your best friend here.

**5. Don't Admit Fault**  
Be polite and cooperative, but don't say "I'm sorry" or "it was my fault"—even if you think it was. Let the insurance companies determine liability.

## After You Leave the Scene

**6. Notify Your Insurance**  
Call your insurance company within 24 hours. Give them the facts without speculation or blame.

**7. Get an Estimate**  
Here's where you have choices—and rights. Many people don't realize:

- **You choose the repair shop**, not your insurance company
- You can get estimates from multiple shops
- The insurance company can't require you to use their "preferred" shop

**8. Understand Your Coverage**

- **Collision Coverage:** Pays for your vehicle damage regardless of fault
- **Comprehensive:** Covers non-collision damage (theft, weather, vandalism)
- **Liability:** Covers damage you cause to others

If the other driver was at fault, their liability insurance should cover your repairs.

## Choosing a Repair Shop

This is important. Your car is a major investment—don't trust it to just anyone.

**Red Flags:**
- Pressure to use a specific shop
- Estimates that seem too good to be true
- Shops that won't let you see their facility
- No written warranty

**Green Flags:**
- Transparent pricing and timelines
- Willing to answer all your questions
- Positive reviews from real customers
- Shows you examples of previous work

## The Repair Process

Once you choose your shop:

1. **Detailed estimate** – Get it in writing
2. **Approval** – Insurance reviews and approves
3. **Supplemental damages** – Sometimes hidden damage is found once work begins (this is normal)
4. **Repair** – Your shop does the work
5. **Quality check** – Inspect the work before you drive off

## Working With Insurance

**Deductible:** You'll pay this amount before insurance covers the rest. If the other driver was at fault, you may not owe a deductible.

**Depreciation:** Some policies have "actual cash value" coverage that factors in depreciation. Others have "replacement cost" coverage which is better.

**Rental Car:** Many policies include rental coverage while your car is in the shop. Ask about it!

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Not getting a police report  
❌ Accepting a cash settlement without repairs  
❌ Letting the other party talk you out of filing a claim  
❌ Choosing a shop based solely on insurance recommendation  
❌ Not reading your estimate carefully
