If you've ever had a shopping cart roll into your door or discovered a mysterious dent after a hailstorm, you know that sinking feeling. But here's the good news: not every dent needs expensive bodywork and a fresh paint job.

## What is Paintless Dent Repair?

Paintless Dent Repair (PDR) is exactly what it sounds like—we remove dents without disturbing your vehicle's original factory paint. Using specialized tools and years of experience, we carefully massage the metal back to its original shape from behind the panel.

## When Does PDR Work?

PDR is perfect for:
- **Door dings** from parking lots
- **Hail damage** (even extensive hail)
- **Minor creases** and dings
- **Dents on body panels** where we can access the backside

The key requirement? Your paint needs to be intact. If the paint is cracked or chipped, we'll need to use traditional repair methods.

## Why Choose PDR Over Traditional Repair?

**1. Preserves Factory Finish**  
Your original paint is always better than a respray. PDR keeps your factory finish intact, which means better resale value.

**2. Faster Turnaround**  
Most PDR jobs are completed in hours, not days. No waiting for paint to dry or cure.

**3. More Affordable**  
Without the cost of materials, paint, and extensive labor, PDR typically costs 50-70% less than traditional bodywork.

**4. Eco-Friendly**  
No chemicals, no paint waste, no fumes. PDR is the greenest option for dent repair.

## The Process

Here at Quick Fix Dent Repair, we start every PDR job with a thorough assessment. We examine the dent's size, depth, and location to determine if it's a good candidate for PDR. 

Using specialized metal rods and body picks, we access the back of the dent (sometimes this means removing interior panels or tail lights). Then, with careful precision, we slowly work the metal back to its original shape. It's part science, part art—and it takes years to master.

## Not All Dents Are Created Equal

While PDR is amazing, it's not magic. Very sharp dents, areas where paint has been damaged, or dents on edges and body lines can be challenging or impossible with PDR alone. That's where our experience comes in—we'll give you an honest assessment and the best solution for your specific situation.
