I know what you're thinking: "Winter car care? In Florida? We don't even have winter!"

While it's true we don't deal with snow and ice, Florida's "winter" months can still take a toll on your vehicle. Here's what you need to know to keep your car looking great through the cooler season.

## The Florida Winter Reality

From December through February, Central Florida experiences:
- **Temperature swings** from 40°F nights to 75°F days
- **Morning dew and moisture** that can sit on your paint
- **Seasonal pollen** (yes, even in winter)
- **More rain** than summer months
- **Tourists** (which means more parking lot dings)

Each of these can affect your vehicle's appearance and condition.

## Paint Protection

**Morning Dew Damage**  
When moisture sits on your car overnight, it can trap contaminants against your paint. Over time, this can cause water spots and etching.

**What to Do:**
- Park in a garage or under cover when possible
- Wax your car before winter hits (creates a protective barrier)
- Dry morning dew with a microfiber towel or leaf blower
- Consider a ceramic coating for serious protection

## Watch for New Dings

The tourist season means crowded parking lots and distracted shoppers. More cars = more opportunities for door dings and shopping cart damage.

**Prevention Tips:**
- Park away from the entrance (worth the walk)
- Choose end spots when possible
- Park next to newer/nicer cars (their owners are more careful)
- Avoid compact spots in tight garages

If you do get a door ding, come see us. Most can be fixed with PDR for a fraction of what you'd expect.

## The Winter Wash Routine

**How Often?**  
Every 2 weeks minimum. Florida's winter brings more rain, which means more road grime and contaminants.

**Best Practices:**
- Wash in the shade or early morning
- Use the two-bucket method (one for soap, one for rinsing)
- Start from the top and work down
- Dry thoroughly with microfiber towels
- Don't forget the wheels and wheel wells

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't use dish soap (strips protective wax)
- Don't wash in direct sunlight (causes water spots)
- Don't skip the dry step (water spots again)
- Don't use the gas station brush wash (scratches paint)

## Protecting Your Interior

Cooler weather means windows up more often, which can trap moisture and odors.

**Winter Interior Care:**
- Crack windows when parked (if safe) to prevent moisture buildup
- Use sunshades (yes, even in winter—UV damage doesn't take a vacation)
- Vacuum regularly to prevent dirt from grinding into carpet
- Treat leather with conditioner (dry winter air can crack leather)
- Keep an interior detailer spray handy for quick touch-ups

## Tire Pressure Matters

Temperature fluctuations affect tire pressure. A 10°F drop can reduce pressure by 1-2 PSI.

**Why It Matters:**
- Under-inflated tires wear faster
- They reduce fuel economy
- They can affect handling

**What to Do:**
Check your tire pressure monthly. The recommended PSI is on a sticker inside your driver's door jamb.

## Paint Chips and Scratches

Winter is actually a great time to fix paint damage. Why?

1. **More comfortable weather** for outdoor work
2. **Paint cures better** in moderate temperatures
3. **Less UV exposure** during curing process
4. **Prevents rust** before summer humidity

Got some scratches or chips you've been putting off? Winter is the perfect time to address them.

## The Tourist Parking Lot Survival Guide

Let's be real: winter in Florida means snowbirds. Here's how to protect your car:

**At Theme Parks:**
- Take a photo of where you parked (seriously)
- Park in the back (fewer people)
- Consider valet if available

**At Shopping Centers:**
- Avoid parking between two vehicles if possible
- Choose spots away from cart returns
- Park next to the landscaped islands (one less side to worry about)

**At Restaurants:**
- Park under lights (discourages dings and theft)
- Avoid parking next to work trucks (they have heavy doors)
- Take end spots when possible

## When Winter Damage Happens

Despite your best efforts, parking lot dings happen. Here's what to do:

**Minor Dings:** PDR can usually handle these same-day. Stop by or text us a photo.

**Scratches:** Depends on depth. Surface scratches can often be buffed out. Deeper ones need paint.

**Bigger Damage:** We handle everything from bumpers to fenders. We work with insurance companies to make it easy.

## Schedule Your Pre-Spring Checkup

Think of this as preventive maintenance. Before the harsh summer sun returns, let's make sure your paint is protected and any winter damage is addressed.

**What We Check:**
- Paint condition and oxidation
- Existing chips and scratches
- Door dings and minor dents
- Trim and molding condition

**Special Winter Offer:**
Mention this blog post and get **10% off** any paint protection service or dent repair through February.

## The Bottom Line

Florida winter might not require snow tires, but it still demands attention to your vehicle. A little prevention now saves major repairs later.
