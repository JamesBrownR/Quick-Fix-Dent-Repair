We were recommended Quick Fix Dent by a local repair business and are so fortunate we were. Chris is the best at auto body repair that I have seen in all my years. There were varying sizes of scratches, scrapes and small dents on both sides. He called with updates as needed and finished the job as promised. He is professional in every way and very reasonable.  We were stunned when we saw her. She was shiny and as close to looking brand new as you could ever get. We highly recommend Chris... he really is the best of the best.

I cannot recommend Chris enough! A great owner who cares about providing high quality work. Chris did a wonderful job with my vehicle. Looks like it came straight from the dealership. He went above and beyond with his work and took care of me. If you need work done on your car, go to Chris!

Expect high quality and a professional atmosphere. Chris, the owner, went above and beyond completely restoring the damage to my vehicle. Chris was more than happy to answer any of my questions and concerns when it came down to cost and time frames for the work. Thank you Quick Fix Dent Repair LLC!

I had someone back into my truck and it mangled my door and fender. I thought it would be in the shop for a long time but I was surprised because it only took around a week and Chris went above and beyond to make it look brand new and functional. I will be using him from now on for any repairs or auto accidents.
